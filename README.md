# Ninja-ARCADE-GAME
``This is a replica of the Frogger arcade game.``

## How To Play
As a Ninja, Patience is of Great Value to avoid excessive violence with ninjutsu.
Using the keyboard, make it safely to the water without harming the sacred bugs or they'll take you back to start again.
* A safe run increases your score

## NOTE
I made changes to the given files since they were too boring for me and created my own story concept with a more interesting character.
